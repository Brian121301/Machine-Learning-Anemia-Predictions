This code aims to experiment with the methods detailed in the article titled "Classifying and Prediction for Patient Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms." The article explores the utilization of three machine learning algorithms - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - to predict anemia cases based on parameters such as age, BMI, blood pressure, among others. Upon running the code, it becomes apparent that in nearly every case, the algorithms presented in the article outperform those implemented here. This difference in performance is likely attributed to the original dataset used in the article, which presumably contained real-time patient information not accessible to the public. 
However, the algorithms demonstrated notable accuracy, indicating their potential effectiveness in real-world scenarios for predicting anemia cases.
